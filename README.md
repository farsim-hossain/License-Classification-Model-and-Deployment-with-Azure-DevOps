# License-Classification-Model-and-Deployment-with-Azure-DevOps
In this project we will create a deep learning model and deploy with Azure DevOps. The model classifies whether a license will be issuied, renewed or cancelled based on other dependent variables. We will first make a baseline model and then we will try to upgrade the model.

# License-Classification-Model-and-Deployment-with-Azure-DevOps
In this project we have developed a deep learning model and deploy with Azure DevOps. The model classifies whether a license will be issuied, renewed or cancelled based on other dependent variables. We will first make a baseline model and then we will try to upgrade the model. The project is explained in my medium blog here : https://medium.com/@farsim/end-to-end-deep-learning-model-developement-and-mlops-using-azure-devops-55f55f4c3a29
